/*
 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Output variable-length bit strings. Compression can be done
 *      to a file or to memory. (The latter is not supported in this version.)
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The PKZIP "deflate" file format interprets compressed file data
 *      as a sequence of bits.  Multi-bit strings in the file may cross
 *      byte boundaries without restriction.
 *
 *      The first bit of each byte is the low-order bit.
 *
 *      The routines in this file allow a variable-length bit value to
 *      be output right-to-left (useful for literal values). For
 *      left-to-right output (useful for code strings from the tree routines),
 *      the bits must have been reversed first with bi_reverse().
 *
 *      For in-memory compression, the compressed bit stream goes directly
 *      into the requested output buffer. The input data is read in blocks
 *      by the mem_read() function. The buffer is limited to 64K on 16 bit
 *      machines.
 *
 *  INTERFACE
 *
 *      void bi_init (FILE *zipfile)
 *          Initialize the bit string routines.
 *
 *      void send_bits (int value, int length)
 *          Write out a bit string, taking the source bits right to
 *          left.
 *
 *      int bi_reverse (int value, int length)
 *          Reverse the bits of a bit string, taking the source bits left to
 *          right and emitting them right to left.
 *
 *      void bi_windup (void)
 *          Write out any remaining bits in an incomplete byte.
 *
 *      void copy_block(char *buf, unsigned len, int header)
 *          Copy a stored block to the zip file, storing first the length and
 *          its one's complement if requested.

/*
 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Identify new text as repetitions of old text within a fixed-
 *      length sliding window trailing behind the new text.
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 *
 *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 *      The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 *      dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 *      completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 *      string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 *      is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 *      insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 *      strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 *      is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 *      A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 *      (by Leonid Broukhis).
 *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 *      time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 *      However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
 *      files if the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
 *
 *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 *
 *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams, and
 *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
 *      Thanks to many info-zippers for bug reports and testing.

   REQUIRE_ORDER means don't recognize them as options;
   stop option processing when the first non-option is seen.
   This is what Unix does.
   This mode of operation is selected by either setting the environment
   variable POSIXLY_CORRECT, or using `+' as the first character
   of the list of option characters.

   PERMUTE is the default.  We permute the contents of ARGV as we scan,
   so that eventually all the non-options are at the end.  This allows options
   to be given in any order, even with programs that were not written to
   expect this.

   RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were written
   to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order and that care about
   the ordering of the two.  We describe each non-option ARGV-element
   as if it were the argument of an option with character code 1.
   Using `-' as the first character of the list of option characters
   selects this mode of operation.

   The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless
   of the value of `ordering'.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating `optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns `EOF'.
   Then `optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
   so that those that are not options now come last.)

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `opterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in `optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
   it is returned in `optarg', otherwise `optarg' is set to zero.

   If OPTSTRING starts with `-' or `+', it requests different methods of
   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.

   Long-named options begin with `--' instead of `-'.
   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
   or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
   argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
   from the option name by a `=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
   When `getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
   `flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's `val' field
   if the `flag' field is zero.

   The elements of ARGV aren't really const, because we permute them.
   But we pretend they're const in the prototype to be compatible
   with other systems.

   LONGOPTS is a vector of `struct option' terminated by an
   element containing a name which is zero.

   LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
   It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
   recent call.

   If LONG_ONLY is nonzero, '-' as well as '--' can introduce
   long-named options.  */

/*
   Inflate deflated (PKZIP's method 8 compressed) data.  The compression
   method searches for as much of the current string of bytes (up to a
   length of 258) in the previous 32K bytes.  If it doesn't find any
   matches (of at least length 3), it codes the next byte.  Otherwise, it
   codes the length of the matched string and its distance backwards from
   the current position.  There is a single Huffman code that codes both
   single bytes (called "literals") and match lengths.  A second Huffman
   code codes the distance information, which follows a length code.  Each
   length or distance code actually represents a base value and a number
   of "extra" (sometimes zero) bits to get to add to the base value.  At
   the end of each deflated block is a special end-of-block (EOB) literal/
   length code.  The decoding process is basically: get a literal/length
   code; if EOB then done; if a literal, emit the decoded byte; if a
   length then get the distance and emit the referred-to bytes from the
   sliding window of previously emitted data.

   There are (currently) three kinds of inflate blocks: stored, fixed, and
   dynamic.  The compressor deals with some chunk of data at a time, and
   decides which method to use on a chunk-by-chunk basis.  A chunk might
   typically be 32K or 64K.  If the chunk is uncompressible, then the
   "stored" method is used.  In this case, the bytes are simply stored as
   is, eight bits per byte, with none of the above coding.  The bytes are
   preceded by a count, since there is no longer an EOB code.

   If the data is compressible, then either the fixed or dynamic methods
   are used.  In the dynamic method, the compressed data is preceded by
   an encoding of the literal/length and distance Huffman codes that are
   to be used to decode this block.  The representation is itself Huffman
   coded, and so is preceded by a description of that code.  These code
   descriptions take up a little space, and so for small blocks, there is
   a predefined set of codes, called the fixed codes.  The fixed method is
   used if the block codes up smaller that way (usually for quite small
   chunks), otherwise the dynamic method is used.  In the latter case, the
   codes are customized to the probabilities in the current block, and so
   can code it much better than the pre-determined fixed codes.
 
   The Huffman codes themselves are decoded using a mutli-level table
   lookup, in order to maximize the speed of decoding plus the speed of
   building the decoding tables.  See the comments below that precede the
   lbits and dbits tuning parameters.

/*
   Notes beyond the 1.93a appnote.txt:

   1. Distance pointers never point before the beginning of the output
      stream.
   2. Distance pointers can point back across blocks, up to 32k away.
   3. There is an implied maximum of 7 bits for the bit length table and
      15 bits for the actual data.
   4. If only one code exists, then it is encoded using one bit.  (Zero
      would be more efficient, but perhaps a little confusing.)  If two
      codes exist, they are coded using one bit each (0 and 1).
   5. There is no way of sending zero distance codes--a dummy must be
      sent if there are none.  (History: a pre 2.0 version of PKZIP would
      store blocks with no distance codes, but this was discovered to be
      too harsh a criterion.)  Valid only for 1.93a.  2.04c does allow
      zero distance codes, which is sent as one code of zero bits in
      length.
   6. There are up to 286 literal/length codes.  Code 256 represents the
      end-of-block.  Note however that the static length tree defines
      288 codes just to fill out the Huffman codes.  Codes 286 and 287
      cannot be used though, since there is no length base or extra bits
      defined for them.  Similarly, there are up to 30 distance codes.
      However, static trees define 32 codes (all 5 bits) to fill out the
      Huffman codes, but the last two had better not show up in the data.
   7. Unzip can check dynamic Huffman blocks for complete code sets.
      The exception is that a single code would not be complete (see #4).
   8. The five bits following the block type is really the number of
      literal codes sent minus 257.
   9. Length codes 8,16,16 are interpreted as 13 length codes of 8 bits
      (1+6+6).  Therefore, to output three times the length, you output
      three codes (1+1+1), whereas to output four times the same length,
      you only need two codes (1+3).  Hmm.
  10. In the tree reconstruction algorithm, Code = Code + Increment
      only if BitLength(i) is not zero.  (Pretty obvious.)
  11. Correction: 4 Bits: # of Bit Length codes - 4     (4 - 19)
  12. Note: length code 284 can represent 227-258, but length code 285
      really is 258.  The last length deserves its own, short code
      since it gets used a lot in very redundant files.  The length
      258 is special since 258 - 3 (the min match length) is 255.
  13. The literal/length and distance code bit lengths are read as a
      single stream of lengths.  It is possible (and advantageous) for
      a repeat code (16, 17, or 18) to go across the boundary between
      the two sets of lengths.

/* Macros for inflate() bit peeking and grabbing.
   The usage is:
   
        NEEDBITS(j)
        x = b & mask_bits[j];
        DUMPBITS(j)

   where NEEDBITS makes sure that b has at least j bits in it, and
   DUMPBITS removes the bits from b.  The macros use the variable k
   for the number of bits in b.  Normally, b and k are register
   variables for speed, and are initialized at the beginning of a
   routine that uses these macros from a global bit buffer and count.

   If we assume that EOB will be the longest code, then we will never
   ask for bits with NEEDBITS that are beyond the end of the stream.
   So, NEEDBITS should not read any more bytes than are needed to
   meet the request.  Then no bytes need to be "returned" to the buffer
   at the end of the last block.

   However, this assumption is not true for fixed blocks--the EOB code
   is 7 bits, but the other literal/length codes can be 8 or 9 bits.
   (The EOB code is shorter than other codes because fixed blocks are
   generally short.  So, while a block always has an EOB, many other
   literal/length codes have a significantly lower probability of
   showing up at all.)  However, by making the first table have a
   lookup of seven bits, the EOB code will be found in that first
   lookup, and so will not require that too many bits be pulled from
   the stream.

/*
   Huffman code decoding is performed using a multi-level table lookup.
   The fastest way to decode is to simply build a lookup table whose
   size is determined by the longest code.  However, the time it takes
   to build this table can also be a factor if the data being decoded
   is not very long.  The most common codes are necessarily the
   shortest codes, so those codes dominate the decoding time, and hence
   the speed.  The idea is you can have a shorter table that decodes the
   shorter, more probable codes, and then point to subsidiary tables for
   the longer codes.  The time it costs to decode the longer codes is
   then traded against the time it takes to make longer tables.

   This results of this trade are in the variables lbits and dbits
   below.  lbits is the number of bits the first level table for literal/
   length codes can decode in one step, and dbits is the same thing for
   the distance codes.  Subsequent tables are also less than or equal to
   those sizes.  These values may be adjusted either when all of the
   codes are shorter than that, in which case the longest code length in
   bits is used, or when the shortest code is *longer* than the requested
   table size, in which case the length of the shortest code in bits is
   used.

   There are two different values for the two tables, since they code a
   different number of possibilities each.  The literal/length table
   codes 286 possible values, or in a flat code, a little over eight
   bits.  The distance table codes 30 possible values, or a little less
   than five bits, flat.  The optimum values for speed end up being
   about one bit more than those, so lbits is 8+1 and dbits is 5+1.
   The optimum values may differ though from machine to machine, and
   possibly even between compilers.  Your mileage may vary.

/*
 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Encode various sets of source values using variable-length
 *      binary code trees.
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The PKZIP "deflation" process uses several Huffman trees. The more
 *      common source values are represented by shorter bit sequences.
 *
 *      Each code tree is stored in the ZIP file in a compressed form
 *      which is itself a Huffman encoding of the lengths of
 *      all the code strings (in ascending order by source values).
 *      The actual code strings are reconstructed from the lengths in
 *      the UNZIP process, as described in the "application note"
 *      (APPNOTE.TXT) distributed as part of PKWARE's PKZIP program.
